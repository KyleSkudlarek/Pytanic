Using machine learning to predict survival for passengers on the Titanic based off available ticket and demographic info (fare, cabin, name, sex, age, etc.). Achieved a survival prediction accuracy of 75%!  Fare (ticket price), Age and Sex were found to be the 3 most significant features preduticing survival. Used the sklearn random forest library to train the model.
