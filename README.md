Using machine learning to predict survival for passengers on the Titanic based off demographic info (age, name, sex, fare, cabin, etc.). Achieved a survival prediction accuracy of 75%! Fare (ticket price), Age and Sex were found to be the 3 most significant features preduticing survival. Used the sklearn random forest library to train the model.
